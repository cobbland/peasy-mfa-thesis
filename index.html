                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>As modern life accelerates, many emerging adults face worsening health outcomes and increased spending linked to their dietary patterns. The convenience of ultra-processed foods, ready-made meals, and on-demand delivery services has made skipping home cooking easier than ever—but convenience comes at a cost.</p>
                <p>Emerging adults (18-29) struggle with home cooking due to perceived time constraints and limited culinary knowledge, resulting in poor nutrition, financial strain, and decreased well-being.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>This study investigates how a visual approach—combining design, photography, and illustration with nutrition—can encourage home cooking. In today’s fast-paced society and overabundance food culture, many emerging adults struggle to prepare meals at home. This study examines how food industry practices and cultural trends shape the eating habits of emerging adults by exploring the reasons behind the decline in home cooking and its adverse effects on health, finances, well-being, and the environment.</p>
                <p>Although research indicates that most adults recognize that home cooking is the healthiest choice, they often do not practice it, citing time and lack of cooking knowledge as their primary obstacles. These findings also reveal a common perception that preparing healthy meals is complex and time-consuming. Some expressed that it is mostly about their organization of time, not their lack of time, that prohibits them from cooking. To identify the most effective way to overcome these barriers, the study combined case studies, visual analyses, and a comprehensive literature review. The resulting visual solution directly addresses the two primary obstacles: perceived time constraints and limited culinary knowledge.</p>
                <p>The key deliverable is a meal-planning kit brand designed to make cooking feel accessible and helps the user build confidence and sustainable habits. </p>

                <h2>Creative Process</h2>
                <p>To address the primary barriers to home cooking for emerging adults, I developed a brand for a weekly meal-planning kit designed to reduce decision fatigue, simplify the cooking process, and build user confidence. </p>
                <p>Research shows that Millennials gravitate toward brands that support their personal growth, curiosity, and social connections, while Gen Z resonate with brands that take tangible steps to address social and environmental challenges while providing products that foster joy, self-expression, and mental well-being. My vision for the brand is to create a product that resonate with both Gen Z and younger millennials—something that supports the users’ personal growth and addresses social challenges, while also fostering joy, self-expression, and well-being. </p>
                <p>The final product includes meal cards, a recipe book, labeled magnets, and a shopping list. The kit includes 30 curated recipes—this quantity is strategically chosen to provide sufficient variety to prevent boredom while remaining small enough for users to master a core rotation, building their confidence before they explore more complex recipes. The ultimate goal is to make cooking fun and achievable, helping users take that first crucial step toward cooking regularly. </p>

                <h2>Final Visual Solution</h2>
                <p>Research shows that emerging adults face two main obstacles to cooking: perceived time constraints and limited culinary knowledge.</p>
                <p><b>Time Barrier:</b> Meal planning is often seen as an overwhelming task, leading to decision fatigue, while healthy cooking is perceived as overly time-consuming and complicated.</p>
                <p><b>Knowledge Barrier:</b> A lack of cooking confidence and recipe ideas leads to “food boredom” and kitchen avoidance.</p>
                <p>The different components of the Peasy Meal Planning Kit are designed to directly address these barriers.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The convenience of modern food culture—from ready-made meals to on-demand delivery—is creating a hidden crisis for emerging adults. Faced with limited time and cooking knowledge, this generation is experiencing a decline in physical health, an increase in financial pressure, and a lower overall quality of life, all directly linked to their dietary habits.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest barriers is the exhausting mental work of deciding what to cook. Many existing tools still overlook this core problem of decision fatigue. My research confirms that emerging adults want to eat healthily but are hindered by decision fatigue, perceived time constraints, and a lack of cooking skills.</p>
                <p>My solution directly addresses this challenge for people who value health but struggle to cook despite their desire to. The resulting product lifts the mental load of meal planning, helping them organize their time and build confidence in the kitchen.</p>
                <p>By mastering a core rotation of 30 balanced recipes, users systematically build cooking knowledge and food literacy—the key to lasting dietary change. My hope is that Peasy will serve as a catalyst, demonstrating that healthy cooking can be possible even in a fast-paced world.</p>
